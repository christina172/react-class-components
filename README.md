Internship 2023 - Fetching and data using React class components

This app (created using create-react-app) fetches all characters from the Rick and Morty API and displays their portrait pictures along with their names. The data is split into 42 pages (20 characters per page). At the bottom of the page there are buttons to navigate to the previous or the next page. Everything is done using class components and lifecycle methods. Styles are added using regular css and css modules.
